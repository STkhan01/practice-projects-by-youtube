        <h2>Father of Pakistan's atomic power</h2>
        <p>He earned his doctorate in <b>engineering from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium.</b> There he pioneered studies in phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges. He then began working at Physical Dynamics Research Laboratory, a subcontractor of the Dutch partner of URENCO. URENCO, a consortium of British, German, and Dutch companies, was established in 1971 to research and develop uranium enrichment through the use of ultracentrifuges, which are centrifuges that operate at extremely high speeds. Khan used this position to steal drawings of centrifuges and assembled a list of mainly European suppliers where those parts could be procured.</p>

        <h3>Earlier Life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                AQ Khan was born in 1936 in the Indian city of Bhopal.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the time, the entire Indian subcontinent was still a part of the British Empire, but things would soon change dramatically. In 1947.
            </li>
            <li>
                British rule finally ended and two new countries were suddenly created: India and Pakistan. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Pakistan was designated as a Muslim country, where India was primarily Hindu.
            </li>
            <li>
                However, both Hindus and Muslims lived throughout both of the new countries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Over the next few years, over four million Hindus moved from Pakistan to India,
            </li>
            <li>
                while over six million Muslims went the other way. It was the biggest mass movement of people in history, and it was not without conflict.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hundreds of thousands of people died as conflict broke out between the two groups.
            </li>
            <li>
                Khan's family was Muslim, but Bhopal was on the Indian side of the partition. 
            </li>
        </ul>
